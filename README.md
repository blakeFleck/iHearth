# **iHearth**

  **iHearth** Currently, there is a disconnect between customer traffic and the number of online reviews. iHearth provides a dynamic business-to-client store management system using the iBeacon technology platform to drive consumer traffic while cultivating in-depth client reviews. Users receive real-time coupons when they are in the vicinity of the iHearth. In turn, business owners are provided data-driven statistics for consumer trends and given the opportunity to collect online reviews.
